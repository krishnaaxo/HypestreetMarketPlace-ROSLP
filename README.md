* Need for developing the website: 

Nowadays a multi-vendor marketplace is an online store that facilitates the sale of products and services from multiple vendors. Typically, the marketplace doesn’t manufacture products or own inventory but acts as a middle-person, connecting buyers with products or services from a seller network.It provides a common platform for all the sellers and buyers to purchase goods at one place and they don't need to struggle finding at multiple websites as it is easy to compare the prices and purchase from the  best offering vendor.

* Problem Definition:

In a marketplace environment, suppliers benefit from having a single portal where they can reach out to multiple customers, while buyers benefit from a competitive environment where suppliers compete for their business which normally leads to reduced prices.The main benefits of a multi-vendor marketplace is the streamlined experience for all parties involved. It’s a lot easier for resellers and manufacturers to connect with a high volume of users and satisfy their specific requirements by gathering multiple product lists in one comprehensive online catalog.
